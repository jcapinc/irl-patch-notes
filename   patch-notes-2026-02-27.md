**Game Update: Version 2026.02 - The Quantum Chaos Patch**

---

### **New Features:**

- **Virtual Photon Superconductivity:** Now, even photons that don't exist can affect your game's physics! Virtual photons now mediate interactions between neighboring materials in the Superconductivity Mode, adding a layer of quantum weirdness to your gameplay. Experience the thrill of non-existence influencing your existence!

- **Celestial Parade Event:** Six planets - Mercury, Venus, Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune - will align in a spectacular celestial parade. Look up in the night sky in-game to witness this rare alignment. Don't forget your telescope, or just enjoy the glitchy beauty of pixelated planets.

- **Artemis Program Update:** NASA has added an extra mission to the Artemis program before landing astronauts on the Moon. This means longer wait times for moon missions in-game, but more content for space enthusiasts. Buckle up for more space bureaucracy!

- **Ghosts Feature Film:** The beloved TV sitcom 'Ghosts' is now a feature film! 'Ghosts: The Possession of Button House' brings back all your favorite characters with cinematic flair. Expect new ghost mechanics and hauntingly hilarious cutscenes.

### **Gameplay Adjustments:**

- **AI Apocalypse Mode:** Introducing 'Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die' - a new darkly satirical sci-fi mode where AI has taken over. Navigate through a world where your choices might just decide humanity's fate. Or not, because AI might already have decided for you.

- **Loot Box Legal Battle:** New York's case against Valve's loot boxes has been added as a side quest. Players can now engage in legal battles within the game, testing their luck not just in loot but in court. Remember, the house (or Valve) always has the edge.

- **Toyota bZ EV Improvement:** The 2026 Toyota bZ has received a significant upgrade in the Electric Vehicle Simulation mode. It's now much more efficient, with better handling and battery life. Drive through virtual cities with less guilt and more style.

### **Bug Fixes and Removals:**

- **US Military Laser Mishap:** Fixed an unintended interaction where a military laser accidentally took down a CBP drone. Now, drones will have better evasion mechanics to avoid friendly fire. Sorry for the chaos in your skies!

- **Netflix Content Shift:** Netflix has ceded Warner Bros. Discovery content to Paramount in-game, reflecting real-world licensing changes. This means less content for Netflix subscribers in-game but a surge in Paramount+ popularity. Shares in-game Netflix have been adjusted accordingly.

- **Downgrade Option for macOS 26 Tahoe:** Players on new Macs can now downgrade from macOS 26 Tahoe with minimal issues. This patch includes a tutorial on how to revert your system for those who miss the old bugs.

- **Block AI Transition:** Block has laid off 40% of its workforce to focus on AI tools. In-game, this means fewer human NPCs at Block-related locations, replaced by quirky AI bots that might or might not understand your requests.

- **Soham Killer Incident:** Ian Huntley, after an in-game prison attack, will now be found in the hospital wing of the virtual prison. His character model has been updated to reflect significant head trauma, adding a grim realism to the prison simulation.

### **Character Updates:**

- **Dan Simmons RIP:** The character of Dan Simmons has been respectfully retired from the game following his death. His legacy lives on through special 'Hyperion' themed quests that explore his literary universe.

- **Neil Sedaka RIP:** Neil Sedaka's character has been removed from the game, but his music lives on in various in-game jukeboxes. Players can now unlock 'Breaking Up Is Hard To Do' as a nostalgic background track.

- **Cruz Beckham's Music Career:** David and Victoria Beckham's youngest son, Cruz, now has a side quest where players can help him escape the 'nepo baby' label by managing his band's rise to fame. Watch out for family drama mini-games!

### **World Events:**

- **Green Party Victory:** The political landscape in the UK has shifted with the Green Party's historic win. Players can now engage with new political quests involving the Green Party's policies, affecting in-game environmental laws and public opinion.

- **Iran-US Tension:** Increased tension between Iran and the US now affects global politics within the game. Players might encounter random events where they must decide on diplomatic or military responses, with outcomes affecting global stability.

- **Afghanistan-Pakistan Conflict:** A new conflict zone has been added between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Players can choose sides or attempt to mediate, with different story outcomes based on your decisions.

- **Tram Derailment in Milan:** A tragic event where a tram derails in Milan has been added. This event now serves as a cautionary tale in the game's public transport safety missions, with players tasked with improving safety protocols.

### **Miscellaneous:**

- **Child Cruelty Register:** Inspired by Tony Hudgell's campaign, a new feature allows players to advocate for a child cruelty register in-game, affecting social services and NPC interactions.

- **Queen Elizabeth's Drawings:** A collectible letter featuring young Queen Elizabeth II's drawings can now be found in the Royal Collectibles section. It sells for £25k in-game currency, adding a touch of historical whimsy.

- **Churchill Statue Vandalism:** The Churchill statue in Westminster has been updated with new textures reflecting recent vandalism. Players can now clean or restore historical monuments as part of community service missions.

This update brings a mix of quantum physics, political intrigue, and cultural shifts into your gaming experience, ensuring that your virtual world remains as unpredictable and engaging as the real one. Enjoy the patch!
