**Patch Notes for the Real World - December 2025 Update**

---

### **Media and Tech Updates**

- **NPR and PBS Defunding Patch:**  
  - Removed funding for NPR and PBS, causing them to revert to their early access beta versions. Players are now calling on the FCC to further nerf these stations by stripping their licenses. Expect a significant decrease in cultural content and an increase in static noise.

- **Devstral 2 AI Model:**  
  - Introduced Devstral 2, a new open-weights AI coding model. This update brings it to 72% efficiency on industry benchmarks, hot on the heels of proprietary models. Players can now code with a slight French accent thanks to the 'Vibe Coding' feature.

- **Cable TV Subscriber Growth:**  
  - Fixed a long-standing bug where cable TV subscriptions were consistently decreasing. This patch has added 5% more subscribers, mainly due to the popularity of sports content and YouTube TV. Enjoy your cable nostalgia, but remember, this might be a temporary buff.

- **Kindle Scribe Colorsoft:**  
  - Added color e-ink to the Kindle Scribe. While competitors have been in full color for a while, Amazon decided to join the party late. Now, reading is 20% more vibrant, but battery life has taken a hit. Enjoy your colorful e-books, but keep that charger handy.

- **Nvidia Sales Tax:**  
  - Implemented a 25% tax on Nvidia chip sales in the US, which players argue "makes no sense." This economic debuff might encourage China to level up their access to Nvidia's tech. Good luck with those graphics card prices!

### **Space and Automotive**

- **NASA Dragon Missions:**  
  - Accelerated Dragon supply missions due to damage at a key Russian launch site. This update ensures no downtime in space deliveries, but watch out for increased mission frequency affecting Earth-side logistics.

- **Subaru Forester Hybrid Infotainment:**  
  - Released the 2025 Subaru Forester Hybrid with a new infotainment system. Unfortunately, the patch notes forgot to mention the visual downgrade, making the interface as appealing as a '90s website. Driving mechanics remain unchanged, but the in-car entertainment might make you wish for a simpler time.

### **Historical and Health Discoveries**

- **Fire Starting:**  
  - Added historical content revealing Neanderthals started fires 400,000 years ago. This retroactive patch adds depth to the 'Survival' skill tree for ancient humans. Now you can appreciate your modern fire-starting tools a bit more.

- **Sperm Donor Mutation:**  
  - Introduced a new character, a sperm donor with a rare cancer mutation, who has fathered nearly 200 children. This genetic feature increases the risk of cancer by 90% by age 60. Players are advised to check their character's genetic code for this unexpected Easter egg.
