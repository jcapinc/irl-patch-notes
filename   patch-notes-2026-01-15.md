---

### **Security & Cyber Warfare**

- **Venezuelan Power Grid Disruption**: Added new feature where US cyber-ops can now "precisely" turn off and on Venezuelan power grids. However, due to lack of certainty, this feature might be more of a 'toggle prank' than a reliable tool. Players are advised to keep flashlights handy. *(Source: [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/unnamed-officials-tell-nyt-precise-cyber-op-took-out-venezuelas-power-grid/))*

### **Economics & Subscription Services**

- **Spotify Subscription Hike**: Increased subscription costs for the third time in 2.5 years. Developers claim this will "benefit artists" - in reality, it benefits Spotify's bottom line.

### **AI & Ethics**

### **Technology & Consumer Goods**

- **Trump Mobile Delivery Delay**: Extended delivery time for preordered Trump Mobile phones by another six months.

- **iOS 26 & Liquid Glass**: Added Liquid Glass feature to iOS 26, causing some controversy.

### **AI & Knowledge Sharing**

- **Wikipedia AI Training Deals**: Wikipedia now shares content with AI giants Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon under new licensing agreements. Knowledge is power, and now, it's monetized.

### **Automotive & Racing**

### **Cultural Misinterpretations**

- **Musk and Hegseth's Star Trek Vision**: New side quest where players can join Elon Musk and Pete Hegseth in their quest to "make Star Trek real" while completely missing the point of the original series.
