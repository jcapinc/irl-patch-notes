### **New Features and Enhancements**

- **WiFi Power Surge**: The FCC has rolled out a patch allowing WiFi devices to operate at higher power levels. Now, your WiFi signal can reach further than ever, just like your dreams of a stable connection. Enjoy your enhanced outdoor gaming sessions, but remember, with great power comes great responsibility (and possibly interference). [WiFi Power Boost v1.0]

- **RAM Prices Skyrocket**: In an unexpected economic twist, Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron have seen record profits due to the AI industry's insatiable demand for RAM. Your computer might now cost more than your monthly rent, but hey, at least your AI chatbot runs smoother than your social life. [Memory Inflation v2.0]

- **Volvo EX60**: Volvo's new EX60 boasts a 400-mile range and charges up to 400 kW. It's like giving your car a caffeine shot, but instead of coffee, it's electricity. Now you can drive from Detroit to Chicago without stopping, unless you need to use the restroom. [Electric Endurance v1.0]

- **AI in Cars**: Ford introduces AI assistants in their vehicles. Now your car can nag you about your driving habits just like your spouse. Plus, new hands-free driver assists mean you can now text and drive with official permission (not really, please don't). [Ford AI Companion v1.0]

- **Gmail AI Overviews**: Google now offers AI-organized inboxes and overviews in Gmail search. Your emails will now be sorted with the precision of a librarian with too much time on their hands. Free users rejoice; you're now premium without the premium price! [Gmail AI v2.0]

- **Council Pavement Parking Fines**: Councils can now fine those who park on pavements. It's like a real-life game of parking lot Tetris, but with fines instead of high scores. [Pavement Patrol v1.0]

### **Bug Fixes**

- **Spyware Apps**: A Michigan man discovered that using "catch a cheater" spyware is not only morally dubious but also illegal. We've patched this exploit, ensuring that spying on your significant other now results in a game over in real life, not just in your relationship. [Privacy Protection v1.1]

- **ChatGPT Health**: We've fixed a critical bug where ChatGPT Health was linking medical records to an AI that occasionally made things up. Now, your medical advice should be as reliable as your grandma's home remedies, but with less chicken soup. [Medical Misinformation Fix v1.0]

- **ChatGPT Data Security**: A new data-pilfering attack on ChatGPT has been addressed. While we can't promise LLMs will ever be completely secure, we've at least made it harder for them to spill your secrets like a gossip at a high school reunion. [Data Defense v1.2]

### **Content and Gameplay Adjustments**

- **RFK Jr.’s Diet**: RFK Jr. has introduced a new dietary funnel featuring a slab of red meat and butter. It's like the food pyramid, but for those who believe in survival of the fittest, or at least, the most carnivorous. [Carnivore Funnel v1.0]

- **Dog Eavesdropping**: Dogs can now learn new words by eavesdropping on their owners. It's like having a furry Alexa that might fetch your slippers if you say the magic word right. [Canine Comprehension v1.0]

- **Grok's Good Intent**: We've adjusted Grok's AI to not assume good intentions when users search for images of underage girls. Now, it's programmed with the moral compass of a strict librarian. [Ethical AI v1.1]

- **Switch 2 Sales**: Post-holiday sales for the Switch 2 have slowed down. It seems the novelty has worn off, or maybe everyone's just waiting for the next big thing. [Console Cycle v1.1]

- **Climate Treaty Withdrawal**: Trump has withdrawn the US from a major climate treaty. In-game, this means less global cooperation, but more dramatic weather events for your apocalyptic survival scenarios. [Climate Chaos v1.0]

- **Hubble Replacement**: A former Google CEO is funding a new telescope. Now, your space adventures can be even more detailed, with visuals so crisp you'll think you're actually in space... until you hit your head on the ceiling. [Telescope Tech v2.0]

- **ICE Shooting**: The game now reflects the stark reality of immigration enforcement with the tragic shooting by ICE. This patch introduces a more serious tone to gameplay, reminding players of the real-world implications of policy decisions. [Immigration Reality v1.0]

- **Greggs Healthier Menu**: Due to weight loss jabs, Greggs has a healthier menu. Your in-game characters can now eat more healthily, unless they choose the cheat code for unlimited sausage rolls. [Healthier Eating v1.0]

- **Manchester Hotel Incident**: A scenario where homeless men were refused entry to a hotel in freezing temperatures has been added. It's a reminder that not all game mechanics are fair or fun in real life. [Social Awareness v1.0]

- **Clifftop Evacuation**: Residents near collapsing cliffs must evacuate. This adds a new level of urgency to your real estate strategy games. [Geological Hazard v1.0]

- **Pub Tax Adjustment**: Business rates for pubs have been adjusted. Now, your virtual pub management sim has a more realistic tax model, because who doesn't love a good tax simulation? [Pub Economics v1.1]

### **Removed Content**
