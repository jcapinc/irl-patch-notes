**Patch Notes 2026.02 - Game of Life Update**

---

**General Updates:**

- **NASA's Starliner Flight**: 
  - *Bug Fix*: Classified the Starliner flight as a "Type A" mishap. The most troubling failure wasn't in the hardware, but in the decision-making algorithms of the agency. We're now implementing a patch to improve error handling in administrative procedures. Remember, folks, sometimes the bug is in the system, not the ship!

- **Rubik’s WOWCube**: 
  - *New Feature*: Added a new puzzle dimension with the Rubik’s WOWCube. This $399 upgrade introduces complexity and possibility, much like adding a fourth dimension to your classic 3D puzzle game. Enjoy the mind-bending fun, but beware, your brain might need an update too!

- **Diablo II Update - Warlock Class**: 
  - *New Class*: Introduced the Warlock to Diablo II. This class brings fresh skill tree paths, giving you a fun twist on the familiar mechanics. Now, go forth and cast spells like it's the first time!

- **Animal Cognition Patch**: 
  - *Gameplay Enhancement*: Updated the sound association mechanics for all in-game animals, from chickens to humans. Now, when you hear "bouba," expect something round. This deep-seated association aims to make your game world more intuitive... or just more amusing.

- **F1 2026 Season**: 
  - *Major Update*: Overhauled the F1 mechanics for 2026. Preseason tests show that everyone's getting mileage on these huge technical changes. Buckle up for a season where aerodynamics and strategy are as unpredictable as a rogue AI.

- **Google Gemini 3.1 Pro**: 
  - *AI Improvement*: Released Gemini 3.1 Pro, now better at complex problem-solving. It's like giving your in-game AI a PhD in quantum physics. Ready to tackle your hardest challenges, or at least pretend to.

- **Amateur Ice Racing**: 
  - *New Mode*: Added Ice Racing to the Extreme Sports DLC. With zero grip and maximum fun, this mode is for those who think roads are overrated. Remember, where we're racing, we don't need roads... or traction.

- **OpenClaw AI Restrictions**: 
  - *Security Patch*: Due to security fears, restricted the use of OpenClaw AI. Known for being highly capable but also wildly unpredictable, like a rogue NPC with too much freedom. Now with safety rails!

- **Dog Learning Mechanics**: 
  - *Behavioral Update*: Rare dogs with gifted word-learning abilities now have increased social motivation to share toys. This could mean your in-game pets might actually want to play fetch... or just share their digital squeaky toys.

**Royalty & Legal Updates:**

- **Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor Arrest**: 
  - *Event Trigger*: Added an event where Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor spends a day at a police station before being released under investigation. This is the first time a senior royal NPC has been arrested in modern history, adding a dramatic twist to the royal storyline.

- **Epstein Investigation**: 
  - *Quest Expansion*: The investigation into Andrew has just begun, with hints that we've only seen the tip of the iceberg. This quest line could expand significantly, offering players new mysteries to solve.

  - *Environmental Impact*: Added a new event where a SpaceX rocket crash leads to a lithium plume. Players must now consider environmental impacts when launching rockets, or face pollution penalties.

- **Cornish Weather**:
