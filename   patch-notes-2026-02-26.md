**Patch Notes Version 2026.02**

---

### **General Updates**

- **xAI Power Plant Noise Reduction**: xAI has spent $7M on the "Temu Sound Wall" feature to attempt to muffle the incessant noise from their power plant. Unfortunately, this update only reduces the noise by a decibel or two, leaving neighbors still quite furious. Expect more patches or perhaps noise-canceling headphones in future updates.

- **Sneaker Physics Update**: Introduced a new physics engine for sneakers where the geometry of tread patterns now determines the frequency of squeaks. Special blocks have been added to play Star Wars music when you walk, turning every step into a mini-concert. May the force be with your footwear!

- **Google Nano Banana 2 AI**: Released Nano Banana 2 AI image model, which immediately replaces all previous versions. This update promises professional results with the speed of a flash. Users might experience a slight banana-themed bias in generated images; we're calling it a feature.

- **Ford Vehicle Update**: A critical patch for Ford trucks and SUVs to fix a bug in towing software. An OTA update will roll out in a few weeks. Until then, owners are advised to avoid towing or visit a dealership for a manual update. We apologize for any inconvenience caused by your vehicle's sudden inability to understand towing dynamics.

- **Wi-Fi Security Patch**: New AirSnitch attack vulnerability discovered. This update advises users to check their guest Wi-Fi networks as they might not be as secure as previously thought. We've added a 'Paranoid Mode' where your Wi-Fi changes its password every hour.

- **ULA's GPS Interference**: ULA's latest rocket anomaly might delay GPS-related missions. Expect longer load times for space missions involving precise navigation. We're working on a fix, but for now, enjoy the scenic routes.
